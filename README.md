## **How the 90% Discount Changes the Local SEO Game Forever**  

Let's break down the math: Whitespark's **Pro Plan** (normally $299/month) drops to just **$29.90/month** with this promotion—that's **$3,588 in annual savings** that can be reinvested into other marketing efforts. Even the **Enterprise Plan** at $999/month becomes **$99.90/month**, delivering **multi-location management and API access** at small business prices. For context, most local SEO agencies charge **$500-$2,000/month** for services that Whitespark automates at 90% off. The implications are staggering:  

- **Restaurants** can outrank chains by building perfect citations  
- **Contractors** can dominate "near me" searches without expensive consultants  
- **Healthcare providers** can manage online reputations across dozens of review sites  
- **Ecommerce brands** with physical locations can boost "buy online, pick up in-store" visibility  

This discount essentially removes the cost barrier between small businesses and enterprise-level local search performance.
